# Testing Your Farcaster Mini App

## ✅ Everything is Set Up Correctly!

Your manifest is live at:
- https://basemaps.vercel.app/.well-known/farcaster.json
- https://api.farcaster.xyz/miniapps/hosted-manifest/019a1c0d-8048-ea2f-a350-31e693ce2f95

## 🚀 How to Make It Discoverable:

### Method 1: Share in a Cast (Recommended)
1. Open Farcaster mobile app
2. Create a new cast
3. Type: `Check out basemaps! 🗺️ https://basemaps.vercel.app`
4. Post it

**What happens:**
- Farcaster detects your Mini App manifest
- Shows a rich preview card with your icon and description
- Anyone can click to launch your app

### Method 2: Direct Access
Share this URL directly with users:
```
https://basemaps.vercel.app
```

When opened in Farcaster, it will launch as a Mini App with:
- ✅ Auto-connected wallet
- ✅ Your splash screen
- ✅ Full app functionality

### Method 3: Test in Warpcast
1. Go to warpcast.com (Farcaster web client)
2. Create a cast with your URL: `https://basemaps.vercel.app`
3. You should see a Mini App preview card

## 📱 Expected Behavior:

When someone clicks your app link in Farcaster:

1. **Splash Screen**: White background with basemaps logo
2. **Auto-connect**: Farcaster wallet connects automatically
3. **Map View**: Opens with Based people locations
4. **Full Features**: Wave, chat, meetups, transactions all work

## 🔍 Why It's Not in Search Yet:

Farcaster's Mini Apps search shows **popular/featured apps**. New apps appear there after:
- Getting usage/engagement
- Being shared in casts
- Building up activity

Your app is **fully functional** - it just needs to be shared!

## 🎉 Your App is Ready!

Just share the URL in Farcaster and it will work perfectly. The manifest is correctly configured with:
- ✅ Account association signed
- ✅ Proper metadata (icon, description, colors)
- ✅ CORS headers working
- ✅ Farcaster-hosted manifest

**Post your first cast with the URL and you're live! 🚀**
