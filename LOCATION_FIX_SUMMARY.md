# Location Tracking Issue - FIXED

## Problem Identified

When you connected a wallet and set your location (e.g., Mumbai), the system had these issues:

1. **Location not saved**: User location was NOT being saved to the database
2. **Hardcoded users**: Map showed hardcoded sample users instead of real database users
3. **No cross-device visibility**: Different wallets couldn't see each other's locations

## Root Causes

### 1. Location Not Saved
- `updateUserLocation()` function existed but was never called
- When user allowed location access, coordinates were only used to center the map
- No database update was triggered

### 2. Hardcoded Sample Users
- Map displayed 4 hardcoded users (Alice, Bob, Charlie, Diana)
- These were NOT from the database
- Real users with saved locations were never fetched or displayed

### 3. No Function to Fetch Users with Locations
- Missing function to query users who have saved their locations

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Save Location Automatically
**File: `components/Map.tsx`**
- When user allows location access, location is now saved to database
- Uses `updateUserLocation(address, latitude, longitude)`
- Updates `last_seen` timestamp on every visit

### 2. Fetch Real Users from Database
**File: `lib/supabase-helpers.ts`**
- Added `getUsersWithLocations()` function
- Fetches all users with non-null latitude/longitude
- Orders by most recently seen

### 3. Display Database Users on Map
**File: `components/Map.tsx`**
- Replaced hardcoded sample users with real database query
- `loadUsersOnMap()` function fetches and displays all users with locations
- Each user appears at their exact saved coordinates
- Works across all devices and wallets

## How It Works Now

### When User Opens Map:
1. **Browser requests location** → User allows/denies
2. **If allowed**: 
   - Location saved to database with wallet address
   - Map centers on user's location
   - "You are here" marker appears
3. **Load other users**:
   - Queries database for all users with locations
   - Displays each user at their saved coordinates
   - Shows wallet/basename and avatar

### When Different Wallet Connects:
- Queries same database
- Sees ALL users who have saved locations
- Including your previous wallet's Mumbai location
- Each wallet is a separate user in the database

## SQL Script

Run `fix-location-tracking.sql` in Supabase SQL Editor to:
- Verify database structure
- Check existing users and locations
- Add helper function for nearby users
- Test the system

## Key Features

✅ **Persistent Locations** - Location saved to database, not just browser
✅ **Cross-Device/Wallet** - Different wallets can see each other
✅ **Real-Time** - Location updates on every map access
✅ **Database-Driven** - No hardcoded users, all from Supabase
✅ **Privacy** - Only users who allow location are shown

## Testing Steps

1. **Connect wallet #1** on Device A
2. **Allow location access** (e.g., Mumbai)
3. **Open Supabase Dashboard** → Check `users` table → Should see your wallet with lat/lng
4. **On Device B, connect wallet #2**
5. **Allow location access** (different location)
6. **Check Map** → You should see wallet #1's marker in Mumbai region

## No More Issues

❌ **Before**: Hardcoded users only
✅ **After**: Real users from database

❌ **Before**: Location not saved
✅ **After**: Location saved automatically

❌ **Before**: Can't see other wallets
✅ **After**: All users with locations visible
