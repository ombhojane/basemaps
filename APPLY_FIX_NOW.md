# üîß Location Tracking Fix - Ready to Apply

## ‚úÖ What Was Fixed

### Problem
- Users' locations were NOT being saved to database
- Map showed hardcoded sample users (Alice, Bob, Charlie, Diana) 
- Different wallets couldn't see each other's locations
- Mumbai location was lost when connecting from another device

### Solution
- Location now saves automatically when user allows location access
- Map fetches and displays REAL users from database
- All wallets can see each other's saved locations
- Locations persist forever until updated

---

## üìÅ Files Modified

### 1. `lib/supabase-helpers.ts`
**Added**: `getUsersWithLocations()` function
- Fetches all users who have saved their location
- Returns users ordered by most recently seen

### 2. `components/Map.tsx`
**Changed**:
- Removed hardcoded sample users (Alice, Bob, Charlie, Diana)
- Added `updateUserLocation()` call when location is detected
- Added `loadUsersOnMap()` to fetch and display database users
- Map now shows real users at their actual coordinates

## ‚ùì Need Help?

### If location not saving:
1. Check wallet is connected BEFORE opening map
2. Ensure location permission allowed in browser
3. Check browser console for errors
4. Verify Supabase credentials in `.env.local`

### If no users visible:
1. Make sure at least one user has allowed location
2. Check Supabase users table - verify lat/lng columns have data
3. Clear browser cache and restart

### If still seeing Alice, Bob, etc:
1. Hard refresh: Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)
2. Clear browser cache completely
3. Restart dev server
4. Check `Map.tsx` file was saved correctly

## üéâ You're All Set!

The fix is applied and ready to test. Just clear cache, restart server, and test with your wallet!

**Remember**: Each wallet address = separate user in database. Location saves automatically when map loads.
