# Transaction Feature Implementation Summary

## Overview
Implemented a complete functional transaction system for sending ETH on **Base Sepolia testnet** with preset and custom amounts.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Payment Modal (`components/PaymentModal.tsx`)
- **Preset Amounts**: 0.01, 0.05, 0.1 ETH buttons
- **Custom Amount**: Input field for custom ETH amounts
- **Recipient Display**: Shows recipient name and avatar
- **Transaction Summary**: Displays amount, network (Base), and recipient address
- **Real-time Status**: Shows transaction hash, confirmation status, and success message
- **Error Handling**: Displays user-friendly error messages

### 2. Map Integration (`components/Map.tsx`)
- Added "Send $" button to user popups on the map
- Opens payment modal when clicked with recipient details
- Passes recipient name and profile image to modal

### 3. Profile Page (`components/Profile.tsx`)
- **Transaction History**: Displays all sent transactions with:
  - Recipient name and address
  - Amount sent in ETH
  - Transaction timestamp
  - Transaction icon
- **Activity Stats**: Shows:
  - Total payments sent count
  - Total ETH sent amount
- **Auto-refresh**: Automatically updates every 2 seconds

### 4. Styling (`app/globals.css`)
- Clean, modern modal design with Base blue theme
- Transaction cards with hover effects
- Status indicators (error, processing, success)
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop

## Technical Details

### Recipient Address
```
0xdc529Ce69Bd28613e23dfb0625B00c7B9f33F8f1
```

### Technologies Used
- **wagmi**: `useSendTransaction`, `useWaitForTransactionReceipt`, `useAccount`, and `useConnect` hooks with MetaMask and Coinbase Wallet connectors
- **viem**: `parseEther` for ETH to Wei conversion
- **localStorage**: Persistent transaction history storage
- **Base Sepolia Testnet**: Configured via OnchainKit provider with `baseSepolia` chain
- **Wallet Support**: MetaMask (primary), Coinbase Wallet

### Transaction Flow
1. User clicks "Send $" on a map marker
2. Payment modal opens with recipient details
3. User selects preset amount or enters custom amount
4. User clicks "Pay X ETH" button
5. Wallet confirmation prompt appears
6. User signs transaction
7. Transaction is broadcast to Base Sepolia testnet
8. Real-time status updates (pending → confirming → success)
9. Transaction saved to localStorage
10. Modal closes automatically on success
11. Profile page updates with new transaction

### Data Structure
```typescript
interface Transaction {
  hash: string;              // Transaction hash
  amount: string;            // Amount in ETH
  recipient: string;         // Recipient address
  recipientName: string;     // Recipient display name
  timestamp: number;         // Unix timestamp
  status: string;            // "success"
}
```

## Files Modified
- `components/PaymentModal.tsx` (new)
- `components/Map.tsx`
- `components/Profile.tsx`
- `app/globals.css`

## Key Features
✓ Preset amounts (0.01, 0.05, 0.1 ETH)
✓ Custom amount input
✓ Base Sepolia testnet support
✓ Real transaction confirmation
✓ Wallet signature required
✓ Transaction history display
✓ Sender profile tracking
✓ Clean, modern UI
✓ Error handling
✓ Auto-refresh transactions

## Bug Fixes Applied

### React Hooks Rule Violation (Fixed)
**Issue**: PaymentModal was returning early before all hooks were called, causing "Rendered more hooks than during the previous render" error.

**Solution**: Moved the early return (`if (!isOpen) return null`) to AFTER all hooks are called. This ensures hooks are always executed in the same order on every render, following React's Rules of Hooks.

### Leaflet Event Listener Error (Fixed)
**Issue**: Leaflet was throwing `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading '_leaflet_pos')` error due to event listener timing issues.

**Solution**:
- Added `setTimeout` wrapper to ensure DOM is ready before attaching event listeners
- Changed from `addEventListener` to `onclick` to prevent multiple listeners
- Applied fix to both location-enabled and fallback marker cases

### Wallet Connection Error (Fixed)
**Issue**: "Error: Connector not connected" when wallet is disconnected or user switches networks.

**Solution**:
- Added `useAccount` hook to check wallet connection status
- Conditionally render "Connect Wallet" button when not connected
- Show payment UI only when wallet is connected
- Added wallet connect section with clear messaging

### Wallet Connector Configuration (Fixed)
**Issue**: "Connect Wallet" button redirecting to Base terms of service page instead of opening wallet connection modal.

**Solution**:
- Replaced OnchainKit's `<Wallet />` component with custom wallet connection buttons using wagmi's `useConnect` hook
- Added proper wagmi configuration with WagmiProvider
- Configured wallet connectors:
  - **MetaMask** (primary - works with installed MetaMask extension)
  - **Coinbase Wallet** (optional, for Coinbase Wallet users)
- Removed WalletConnect to avoid Project ID configuration requirement
- Added QueryClientProvider for wagmi state management
- Configured Base Sepolia testnet transport
- Created custom styled wallet option buttons that directly trigger wallet connection
