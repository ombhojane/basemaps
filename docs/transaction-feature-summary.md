# Transaction Feature Implementation Summary

## Overview
Implemented a complete functional transaction system for sending ETH on **Base Sepolia testnet** with preset and custom amounts.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Payment Modal (`components/PaymentModal.tsx`)
- **Preset Amounts**: 0.01, 0.05, 0.1 ETH buttons
- **Custom Amount**: Input field for custom ETH amounts
- **Recipient Display**: Shows recipient name and avatar
- **Transaction Summary**: Displays amount, network (Base), and recipient address
- **Real-time Status**: Shows transaction hash, confirmation status, and success message
- **Error Handling**: Displays user-friendly error messages

### 2. Map Integration (`components/Map.tsx`)
- Added "Send $" button to user popups on the map
- Opens payment modal when clicked with recipient details
- Passes recipient name and profile image to modal

### 3. Profile Page (`components/Profile.tsx`)
- **Transaction History**: Displays all sent transactions with:
  - Recipient name and address
  - Amount sent in ETH
  - Transaction timestamp
  - **Up arrow icon** (red) indicating sent transactions
  - **"View on BaseScan" link** - Opens transaction details on Base Sepolia explorer in new tab
- **Activity Stats**: Shows:
  - Total payments sent count
  - Total ETH sent amount
- **Auto-refresh**: Automatically updates every 2 seconds

### 4. Styling (`app/globals.css`)
- Clean, modern modal design with Base blue theme
- Transaction cards with hover effects
- Status indicators (error, processing, success)
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop

## Technical Details

### Recipient Address
```
0xdc529Ce69Bd28613e23dfb0625B00c7B9f33F8f1
```

### Technologies Used
- **wagmi**: `useSendTransaction`, `useWaitForTransactionReceipt`, `useAccount`, and `useConnect` hooks with MetaMask and Coinbase Wallet connectors
- **viem**: `parseEther` for ETH to Wei conversion
- **localStorage**: Persistent transaction history storage
- **Base Sepolia Testnet**: Configured via OnchainKit provider with `baseSepolia` chain
- **Wallet Support**: MetaMask (primary), Coinbase Wallet

### Transaction Flow
1. User clicks "Send $" on a map marker
2. Payment modal opens with recipient details
3. User selects preset amount or enters custom amount
4. User clicks "Pay X ETH" button
5. Wallet confirmation prompt appears
6. User signs transaction
7. Transaction is broadcast to Base Sepolia testnet
8. Real-time status updates (pending → confirming → success)
9. Transaction saved to localStorage
10. Modal closes automatically on success
11. Profile page updates with new transaction

### Data Structure
```typescript
interface Transaction {
  hash: string;              // Transaction hash
  amount: string;            // Amount in ETH
  recipient: string;         // Recipient address
  recipientName: string;     // Recipient display name
  timestamp: number;         // Unix timestamp
  status: string;            // "success"
}
```

## Bug Fixes Applied

### React Hooks Rule Violation (Fixed)
**Issue**: PaymentModal was returning early before all hooks were called, causing "Rendered more hooks than during the previous render" error.

**Solution**: Moved the early return (`if (!isOpen) return null`) to AFTER all hooks are called. This ensures hooks are always executed in the same order on every render, following React's Rules of Hooks.

### Leaflet Event Listener Error (Fixed)
**Issue**: Leaflet was throwing `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading '_leaflet_pos')` error due to event listener timing issues.

**Solution**:
- Added `setTimeout` wrapper to ensure DOM is ready before attaching event listeners
- Changed from `addEventListener` to `onclick` to prevent multiple listeners
- Applied fix to both location-enabled and fallback marker cases

### Wallet Connection Error (Fixed)
**Issue**: "Error: Connector not connected" when wallet is disconnected or user switches networks.

**Solution**:
- Added `useAccount` hook to check wallet connection status
- Conditionally render "Connect Wallet" button when not connected
- Show payment UI only when wallet is connected
- Added wallet connect section with clear messaging

### Wallet Connector Configuration (Fixed)
**Issue**: "Connect Wallet" button redirecting to Base terms of service page instead of opening wallet connection modal.

**Solution**:
- Replaced OnchainKit's `<Wallet />` component with custom wallet connection buttons using wagmi's `useConnect` hook
- Added proper wagmi configuration with WagmiProvider
- Configured wallet connectors:
  - **MetaMask** (primary - works with installed MetaMask extension)
  - **Coinbase Wallet** (optional, for Coinbase Wallet users)
- Removed WalletConnect to avoid Project ID configuration requirement
- Added QueryClientProvider for wagmi state management
- Configured Base Sepolia testnet transport
- Created custom styled wallet option buttons that directly trigger wallet connection

## Code Optimization & Cleanup

### Dead Code Removed
- **Deleted `app/page.module.css`**: Entire file was unused (not imported anywhere)

### app/rootProvider.tsx Optimizations
- Renamed `config` to `wagmiConfig` for clarity
- Removed redundant `preference: "all"` from coinbaseWallet (default value)
- Removed unnecessary `config` object with appearance and wallet settings (not needed with custom buttons)
- Removed explicit `notificationProxyUrl: undefined` (unnecessary)
- **Result**: Reduced from 55 to 42 lines (-23% size)

### app/page.tsx Optimizations
- Removed redundant comments (code is self-documenting)
- Simplified useEffect condition to one-liner
- Cleaner code structure

### app/layout.tsx Optimizations
- Moved font declarations to top for better organization
- Converted font declarations to one-liners
- Added `appName` variable to avoid repetition
- Removed unnecessary `Readonly<>` wrapper
- Simplified type annotations
- **Result**: More readable and maintainable

### Core Logic Maintained
✅ All functionality preserved  
✅ No breaking changes  
✅ Zero linter errors  
✅ Cleaner, more maintainable codebase

## UI/UX Enhancements

### Transaction Display Improvements
**1. Up Arrow Icon for Sent Transactions**
- Changed arrow direction from down (↓) to up (↑) to correctly indicate outgoing payments
- Applied red color scheme to sent transaction icons for better visual distinction
- Icon color: `#ef4444` (red) with light red background

**2. BaseScan Explorer Integration**
- Added "View on BaseScan" link button for each transaction
- Opens transaction details in new tab on Base Sepolia explorer
- Link format: `https://sepolia.basescan.org/tx/{transactionHash}`
- Features external link icon for clear indication
- Hover effects: elevated shadow, blue highlight
- Clean, compact button design that doesn't clutter the UI

**3. Transaction Card Layout Improvements**
- Restructured layout with header and footer sections
- **Header section**: Name, address, and timestamp on left; amount on right with optimized spacing
- **Footer section**: BaseScan link below timestamp with divider line
- Date and time combined in single row for cleaner look
- Amount positioned with better spacing (not too far right/up)
- Fixed overflow issue by adjusting padding in transactions list
- Added subtle border-top divider between content and footer
- Better visual hierarchy and cleaner information flow following UX best practices

**4. Wallet Display with Basename Support**
- Fetches Basename from Base Mainnet using OnchainKit's `getName` function
- Shows Basename if available, otherwise displays shortened wallet address
- **Important**: Basenames only exist on Base Mainnet (chain ID 8453), not on Sepolia testnet
- Even when using Base Sepolia for transactions, the app checks Base Mainnet for Basename
- Displays loading state while fetching name
- Clean display with blue icon and monospace font
- Automatically resolves Basename for any connected wallet address

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Select preset amount
- [ ] Enter custom amount
- [ ] Confirm transaction in wallet
- [ ] Verify transaction appears in profile with up arrow icon (red)
- [ ] Verify transaction layout: amount on right side of name/address
- [ ] Verify BaseScan link is below timestamp (not beside amount)
- [ ] Click "View on BaseScan" link to verify it opens in new tab
- [ ] Check transaction stats update
- [ ] Verify no overflow issues on transaction cards
- [ ] Test error handling (reject transaction)
- [ ] Verify mobile responsiveness
- [ ] Test with location enabled/disabled
- [ ] Verify BaseScan link shows correct transaction details
